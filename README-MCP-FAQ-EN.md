# TrendRadar MCP Tool Usage Q&A

> AI Query Guide - How to Use News Trend Analysis Tools Through Conversation

## ⚙️ Default Settings Explanation (Important!)

The following optimization strategies are adopted by default, mainly to save AI token consumption:

| Default Setting | Description | How to Adjust |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Result Limit** | Default returns 50 news items | Say "return top 10" or "give me 100 items" in conversation |
| **Time Range** | Default queries today's data | Say "query yesterday", "last week" or "Jan 1 to 7" |
| **URL Links** | Default no links (saves ~160 tokens/item) | Say "need links" or "include URLs" |
| **Keyword List** | Default does not use frequency_words.txt to filter news | Only used when calling "trending topics" tool |

**⚠️ Important:** The choice of AI model directly affects the tool call effectiveness. The smarter the AI, the more accurate the calls. When you remove the above restrictions, for example, from querying today to querying a week, first you need to have a week's data locally, and secondly, token consumption may multiply (why "may", for example, if I query "analyze 'Apple' trend in the last week", if there isn't much Apple news in that week, then token consumption may actually be less).

**💡 Tip:** This project provides a dedicated date parsing tool `resolve_date_range`, which can accurately parse natural language date expressions like "last 7 days", "this week", ensuring all AI models get consistent date ranges. Recommended to use this tool first, see Q18 below for details.


## 💰 AI Models

Below I use the **[SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn)** platform as an example, which has many large models to choose from. During the development and testing of this project, I used this platform for many functional tests and validations.

## Basic Queries

### Q1: How to view the latest news?

**You can ask like this:**

- "Show me the latest news"
- "Query today's trending news"

- Does not include URL links (saves tokens)

**AI display behavior (Important):**

- ⚠️ **AI usually auto-summarizes**, only showing partial news (like TOP 10-20 items)
- ✅ If you want to see all 50 items, need to explicitly request: "show all news" or "list all 50 items completely"
- 💡 This is the AI model's natural behavior, not a tool limitation

**Can be adjusted:**

- Specify platform: like "only Zhihu"
- Adjust quantity: like "return top 20"
- Include links: like "need links"
- **Request full display**: like "show all, don't summarize"

**Return information:**

- synced_files: Number of successfully synced files
- synced_dates: List of successfully synced dates

**Return information (both mode):**

- only_local: Dates only existing locally
- only_remote: Dates only existing remotely (useful for deciding which dates to sync)
- both: Dates existing in both places

---

### Q18: How to parse natural language date expressions? (Recommended to use first)

**You can ask like this:**

- "Parse what days 'this week' is"
- "What date range does 'last 7 days' correspond to"
- "Last month's date range"
- "Help me convert 'last 30 days' to specific dates"

**Tool called:** `resolve_date_range`

**Why is this tool needed?**

Users often use natural language like "this week", "last 7 days" to express dates, but different AI models calculating dates on their own will produce inconsistent results. This tool uses server-side precise time calculations to ensure all AI models get consistent date ranges.

**Supported date expressions:**

| Type | Chinese Expression | English Expression |
|------|---------|---------|
| Single Day | 今天、昨天 | today, yesterday |
| Week | 本周、上周 | this week, last week |
| Month | 本月、上月 | this month, last month |
| Last N Days | 最近7天、最近30天 | last 7 days, last 30 days |
| Dynamic | 最近N天 (any number) | last N days |

**Return format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "expression": "this week",
  "date_range": {
    "start": "2025-11-18",
    "end": "2025-11-26"
  },
  "current_date": "2025-11-26",
  "description": "This week (Monday to Sunday, 11-18 to 11-26)"
}
```

**Recommended usage flow:**

```
User: Analyze AI's sentiment this week
Recommended steps:
1. AI first calls resolve_date_range("this week") → gets {"start": "2025-11-18", "end": "2025-11-26"}
2. AI calls analyze_sentiment(topic="AI", date_range=date_range from previous step)

User: Check Tesla news from last 7 days
Recommended steps:
1. AI calls resolve_date_range("last 7 days") → gets precise date range
2. AI calls search_news(query="Tesla", date_range=date_range from previous step)
```

**Usage advantages:**

- ✅ **Consistency**: All AI models get the same date range
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Based on server-side Python `datetime.now()` calculation
- ✅ **Standardization**: Returns standard `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Supports Chinese/English, dynamic days (last N days)

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### 1. How to make AI display all data instead of auto-summarizing?

**Background**: Sometimes AI automatically summarizes data, only showing partial content, even if the tool returned complete 50 items of data.

**If AI still summarizes, you can**:

- **Method 1 - Explicit request**: "Please show all news, don't summarize"
- **Method 2 - Specify quantity**: "Show all 50 news items"
- **Method 3 - Question the behavior**: "Why only showed 15? I want to see all"
- **Method 4 - State upfront**: "Query today's news, fully display all results"

**Note**: AI may still adjust display method based on context.


### 2. How to combine multiple tools?

**Example: In-depth analysis of a topic**

1. Search first: "Search for news about 'artificial intelligence'"
2. Then analyze trends: "Analyze the heat trend of 'artificial intelligence'"
3. Finally sentiment analysis: "Analyze sentiment of 'artificial intelligence' news"

**Example: Track an event**

1. View latest: "Query today's news about 'iPhone'"
2. Find history: "Find historical news related to 'iPhone' from last week"
3. Find similar reports: "Find news similar to 'iPhone launch event'"
